# Working

Active feature specifications. One subfolder per feature, with its own `spec.md`.

## Structure

```
working/
├── _template/
│   ├── spec.md        # Base template — copy for every new feature
│   └── tasks.md       # Task list template — generated by validator agent
└── [feature-name]/
    ├── spec.md        # Feature specification
    └── tasks.md       # Task list (generated after spec validation)
```

## Usage rules

- Create a subfolder for each feature before implementing anything.
- Copy `_template/spec.md` and fill it in.
- Run the validator agent (`ia_docs/06-agente-validador.md`) before starting implementation.
- Only start coding after the validator confirms the spec is complete.
- Keep `spec.md` updated if requirements change during implementation.

## Naming convention

Use lowercase kebab-case for folder names. Examples:
- `working/user-login/`
- `working/dashboard/`
- `working/contract-list/`
